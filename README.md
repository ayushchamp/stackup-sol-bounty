**Function Name:** upgradeToAndCall

**Block Explorer Link:** https://etherscan.io/address/0xa700b4eb416be35b2911fd5dee80678ff64ff6c9#code#F6#L1

**Function Code:**

```solidity
modifier ifAdmin() {
    if (msg.sender == _admin) {
        _;
    } else {
        _fallback();
    }
}

function upgradeToAndCall(address newImplementation, bytes calldata data)
    external
    payable
    ifAdmin
{
    _upgradeTo(newImplementation);
    (bool success, ) = newImplementation.delegatecall(data);
    require(success);
}
```

**Used Call Method:** delegatecall

# Explanation

## **Purpose:**
The `upgradeToAndCall` function in the `BaseImmutableAdminUpgradeabilityProxy` contract allows the contract's admin to upgrade the implementation of the proxy and simultaneously call a function on the new implementation. This is useful for initializing or configuring the new implementation immediately after the upgrade.

## **Detailed Usage:**

### **1. Admin Check:**
The `ifAdmin` modifier ensures that only the admin can call functions protected by it. If the caller is not the admin, the function falls back to `_fallback()`.

```solidity
modifier ifAdmin() {
    if (msg.sender == _admin) {
        _;
    } else {
        _fallback();
    }
}
```

### **2. Upgrade and Call:**
The `upgradeToAndCall` function performs two main tasks:
- **Upgrade:** It upgrades the proxy to a new implementation.
- **Delegate Call:** It then uses `delegatecall` to call a function on the new implementation with provided data.

```solidity
function upgradeToAndCall(address newImplementation, bytes calldata data)
    external
    payable
    ifAdmin
{
    _upgradeTo(newImplementation);
    (bool success, ) = newImplementation.delegatecall(data);
    require(success);
}
```

## **Impact:**

The `upgradeToAndCall` function is crucial for the Aave V3 protocol's functionality within the protocol for several reasons:

### **1. Upgradability:** 
It allows the contract to be upgraded seamlessly without changing the proxy's address or disrupting the contract's state.

### **2. Initialization:**
By calling a function on the new implementation immediately after upgrading, it ensures that any required initialization or configuration can be done in the same transaction, avoiding potential issues from having an uninitialized implementation.

### **3. Security:**
The `ifAdmin` modifier adds a layer of security, ensuring that only authorized addresses (the admin) can perform upgrades, thus protecting the protocol from unauthorized changes.
